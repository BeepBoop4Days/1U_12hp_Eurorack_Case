# 1U_12hp_Eurorack_Case
A 1U 12HP eurorack case. Standalone, USB-C powered, and designed to fit [Bib](https://plinkysynth.com/docs/bib-manual) as an end of chain effect for groove boxes and synths.

Available in 2 versions, with and without 3.5mm stereo outputs from the back of the module. 'wIO' is with the stereo IO holes. My stereo jacks are a little shorter than intended, so I drilled the holes out but left the model at MMC.

Can be printed with a 0.6 mm or smaller nozzle, ~0.2 mm layer height, FDM. Modeled in supports for the rails, to be removed with a long pokey thing.
