## Description
A 1U 12HP eurorack case. Standalone, USB-C powered, and designed to fit [**Bib**](https://plinkysynth.com/docs/bib-manual) as an end of chain effect for groove boxes and synths.

Available in 2 versions, with and without 3.5mm stereo input and output on the case. **'wIO'** is with the stereo IO holes. 

Can be printed with a 0.6 mm or smaller nozzle, ~0.2 mm layer height, FDM. 

## BOM
- USB-C Panel mount https://a.co/d/j9zBBSZ
  - JST PH 2A Connector (for USB-C connector, optional)
- Power Supply DD1718PA, or similar like https://a.co/d/fDGZoHY
  - Power Supply connector, I used 5 pin Dupont, but you could also use a 10 pos IDC
- Extra 100 uF Electrolytic Capacitors for the power rails (why not?)
- for **wIO** variant,
  - 2x Stereo Jacks 
  - 2x3 pos connector, I used 2x 3 pos Dupont, but you could also use 6 pos IDC 

## Notes
- My stereo jacks were a little shorter than intended, so I drilled the holes out (allowing the jacks to sit deeper), but left the model at maximum material condition.
- Modeled in supports for the rails, to be removed with a long pokey thing.
  - These seem to be out of place in the *.stl's but are were fine when I printed from the *.step files
